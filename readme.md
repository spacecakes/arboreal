#Arboreal Company Website
https://spacecakes.github.io/arboreal/

##Purpose
Website originally made as a CSS and HTML excercise and is my first website created from scratch.

##Design choices
I wanted a lively, playful look with nice colors. The look *does not* match the business-y corporation it's intended for, but since this wasn't a design assignment I decided to go for my own look and view the content as placeholders.

It uses a (sticky) menubar on top, parallax scrolling and is fully responsive. 

##Validation
The website validates with the exception of a few experimental, but non-critical features. I decided to keep these because they do not affect the experience poorly in any way. Instead, they provide tiny benefits in browsers that do support it: a sticky menubar and background blur (in Safari).
